===================================
SciPy 2013: ``skimage.viewer`` demo
===================================

Demo scripts used in my SciPy 2013 lightening talk on the scikit-image viewer.
I only demoed examples 3--7 during the talk. Note that a recent version of
scikit-image master is required to run these demos.

(The viewer-linking functionality and some PySide fixes were merged on
June 28th.) Examples of the viewer live in the main repo at

https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/tree/master/viewer_examples

Unfortunately, these examples haven't yet been integrated with the scikit-image
gallery because the gallery build only works with matplotlib figures.

Follow the link below to see a video of the lightening talk.
